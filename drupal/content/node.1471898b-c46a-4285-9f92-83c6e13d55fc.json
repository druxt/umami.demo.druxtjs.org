Add a few sprigs of mint for an authentic look.<\/p>\n<h2>Sinless Strawberry Martini<\/h2>\n<p>Strawberries add a beautiful rich red to this mocktail, while the ginger gives it a little kick. Serve in a proper martini glass, but maybe avoid the olives.<\/p>\n<h3>Instructions:<\/h3>\n<p>Muddle a strawberry with a dash a ginger beer and some sugar syrup in a cocktail shaker.
